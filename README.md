# React-Native-Apps
A Repo for React Native apps that I've built.

I try to keep a coherent minimalist UI throughout all my app. This involves a dark theme with white (primary) and blue and pink/'infrared' (secondary) text colors. 
I try to use good signifiers as far as possible, and an intuitive feedback system for user input (eg: changing text color of BPM in a metronome while user is editing BPM).

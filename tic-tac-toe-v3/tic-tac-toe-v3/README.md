# Tic Tac Toe v3
-The big boi version of TTT

A regular game of Tic Tac Toe, but with user editable icons for X and O (i.e you could play using the B emoji and an xD emoji)
Player names are editable, so you can show that "John Doe won!" or "Jane Doe won!"

As always, using a minimalist UI that looks nice (to me at least).
